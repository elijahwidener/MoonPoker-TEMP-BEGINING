# This is the start of a large scale project to create a PokerNow copycat which has additional features
# This website will be better in many ways. Firstyly, it will have the option to add bomb pots, and even have a bomb pot button move counter the dealer button
# These bomb pots are customizable, with double boards, PLO, and the amount

# This website will also allow for bounties. Allow someone to enter a hand that will win a bounty. E.g 2/7 or 10/2. Customize the amount they can win

# It will also be able to initiate the standup game, adding a token whjenever someone “Sits down”
# The amount paid will be customizable and automatic once the game is over.

# Finally, the website will be able to play much more than just holdem and PLO.
# Stud games like razz, stud8, et c. will be available. 

# Draw games also will be available, 2/7, badugi, LOTS.
	
# Also potentially add the ability to make it dealers' choice. 

# Allow players to send things like tilt cards, or emojis to other players, like in zynga poker. These can be a premium feature. 

#add functionality to be able to play against GTO bots
